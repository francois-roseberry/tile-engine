# tile-engine

Free and open-source 2D isometric tile-engine in XNA.
Currently under development, any help is welcome !

Features implemented :
- Showing a viewport of map
- Moving camera
- Highlighting the tile currently hovered by mouse (Mouse picking)
- Two level of zoom (normal and zoomed-in)
- Culling

To be done next :
- Putting it inside a UI (with a side panel (containing a mini-map) on the right and a menu bar on top)
- Drawing objects larger than 1 tile
- Reorientation of map's view (north, south, east, west)
- Changing the cursor to reflect the action
- Adding a custom Pipeline deserializer to read a tile map
- Putting two layers on tiles (base and top)


Eventually, may serve as a basis for a remake of a classic city builder game like Pharaoh
or pathfinding sample, where character follows where mouse click, like Diablo
