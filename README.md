# tile-engine

2D Tile engine in XNA

Features implemented :
- Showing a viewport of map
- Moving camera

To be done next :
- Changing the cursor to reflect the action
- Mouse picking of tiles
- Drawing different types of tiles
- Adding a custom Pipeline deserializer to read a tile map
- Putting two layers on tiles (base and top)

Eventually, may serve as a basis for a remake of a classic city builder game like Pharaoh
