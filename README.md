# tile-engine [Halted]

Free and open-source 2D isometric tile-engine in XNA.
Any help is welcome !

Features implemented :
- Showing a viewport of map
- Moving camera
- Highlighting the tile currently hovered by mouse (Mouse picking)
- Two level of zoom (normal and zoomed-in)
- Culling
- Basic UI (partially fonctional)

To be done next :
- UI : functional minimap and menu, dialogs, adding tools to SidePanel
- Drawing objects larger than 1 tile
- Reorientation of map's view (north, south, east, west)
- Changing the cursor to reflect the action
- Adding a custom Pipeline deserializer to read a tile map
- Putting two layers on tiles (base and top)


Eventually, may serve as a basis for a remake of a classic city builder game like Pharaoh
or pathfinding sample, where character follows where mouse click, like Diablo
