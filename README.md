# tile-engine

2D Tile engine in XNA

Features implemented :
- Showing a viewport of map
- Moving camera
- Highlighting the tile currently hovered by mouse (Mouse picking)

To be done next :
- Adjust the zoom level of the camera
- Changing the cursor to reflect the action
- Adding a custom Pipeline deserializer to read a tile map
- Putting two layers on tiles (base and top)
- Reorientation of map's view (north, south, east, west)

Eventually, may serve as a basis for a remake of a classic city builder game like Pharaoh
